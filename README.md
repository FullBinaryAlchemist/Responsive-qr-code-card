## My process

1. Start first with html markups 
2. Create a separate styles folder and then achieve the most basic styles like setting background, flex display, centering
3. Make responsive using "max-width" and "max-height" properties and using percentages wherever possible

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


1. How to make responsive just using css and flexbox

2. Use box shadows

3. Use global css variables

```css
:root{
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

Further developements plans:
1. Refactor using SASS preprocessor
2. Set up css & html linting through prettier project level config
3. Rewrite as a React component
4. Deploy as a Next.js website
5. Improve accessiblity
